# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a dynamically generated HTML gameboard for two players ('X' and 'O') who take turns making moves. JavaScript functions handle win/tie detection, and a "Reset" button allows for starting new games.
